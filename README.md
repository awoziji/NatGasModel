# NatGasModel
World Model for Natural Gas Trade

ABM market model based on the natural gas market written in Python.

Note: This model is written as part of my graduation thesis and is currently being expanded. As part of the academic trajectory I record every major addition to the model in a seperate Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file. The latest of these files is the most recent model.
